Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```

Let's break down the code step by stepppppp:

1. **Package Declaration**: The first line `package main` tells the computer that this code is part of a package named "main". A package is like a collection of code that serves a specific purpose. In this case, the package named "main" is a special package because it contains the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.

2. **Import Statement**: The line `import "fmt"` is used to bring in some extra functionality from another package called "fmt". This package provides functions to format and output text.

3. **Function Definition**: The next part `func main()` defines a function named `main`. A function is like a little piece of code that does a specific task. The `main` function is special because it's the starting point of the program's execution. Whatever is inside this function will be executed when the program runs.

4. **Print Statement**: Inside the `main` function, `fmt.Println("hello world")` is written. This line is using the `Println` function from the "fmt" package. It's asking the computer to print the words "hello world" on the screen.

So, when you put all these parts together and run the program, it will do just one thing: show the words "hello world" on your screen.

It's like telling the computer, "Hey computer, I want you to show me the words 'hello world'." And the computer follows your instructions and shows those words to you!
